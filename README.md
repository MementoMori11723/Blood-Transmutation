- **Make**: Commonly available on Unix-based systems. Windows users can install it or use a Unix compatibility layer like Cygwin.

### Steps to Run

1. **Download the Project**

   - Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   - Open your terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows).
   - Use the `cd` command to navigate to the project's directory.

3. **Run the Application**

   - Execute the following command:
     ```bash
     make run
     ```
   - This command uses the Makefile to compile and start the application automatically.

4. **Access the Web Application**

   - Open your preferred web browser.
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:8080` (or the port specified in the terminal).
   - You should see the Blood Transmutation Dashboard.

### Using the Dashboard

1. **Select Blood Groups**

   - You'll find two dropdown menus labeled "Blood Group 1" and "Blood Group 2".
   - Click each menu and select the desired blood groups you wish to explore.

2. **Get Information**

   - Click the "Get Info" button.
   - The application will process your request. A loading message will appear briefly.

3. **View Results**

   - Information about the conversion process between the selected blood groups will be displayed.
   - The result includes HTML data returned from Level 4 of the AI model, which is directly used in the application.
   - If there's an error or missing information, an appropriate message will appear.

## Understanding How the Project Works

### Multi-Level Machine Learning Model

The project's core is a four-level AI model designed to simulate the complex process of blood transmutation. Here's how each level contributes:

1. **Level 1 - Component Generation**:

   - **Function**: Identifies and lists the combinations and chemical names of blood components relevant to the selected blood groups.
   - **Outcome**: Provides a detailed breakdown of the necessary elements for the conversion.

2. **Level 2 - Reaction Formulation**:

   - **Function**: Uses the data from Level 1 to generate proper chemical reactions that could facilitate the conversion.
   - **Outcome**: Outlines potential biochemical reactions required.

3. **Level 3 - Categorization**:

   - **Function**: Categorizes the reactions based on their suitability and efficiency in achieving the desired blood group conversion.
   - **Outcome**: Prioritizes reactions that are most feasible.

4. **Level 4 - Details and HTML Data Generation**:

   - **Function**: Provides detailed information on each reaction, including cost estimates and status (e.g., theoretical, experimental).
   - **Outcome**: Returns HTML data that is directly integrated into the application for display to the user.

### The Role of Go and ChatGPT

- **Go (Golang)**:

  - Manages the server-side logic and handles incoming requests.
