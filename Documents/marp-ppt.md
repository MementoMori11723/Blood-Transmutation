## Key Concepts

### 1. Blood Group Antigens & Genetic Markers

- **Blood Group Antigens**: 
  - Blood types are determined by specific antigens on red blood cells.
  - Main blood groups: A, B, AB, and O (classified further by Rh factor).

- **Genetic Markers**: 
  - Specific DNA sequences associated with blood type traits.
  - Understanding these markers helps in developing methods to alter blood types safely.
